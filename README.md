# UMich_DeepRob
This repo contains projects from 'DeepRob: Deep Learning for Robot Perception' at UMich

# Project 0:

The objective of the first project is to gain experience working with the Python scripting languange and the PyTorch machine learning framework using the Google Colab development environment. In this project you will implement a collection of functions using core functionality of PyTorch Tensor objects.

# Project 1:

The objective of this project is to gain experience building a machine learning pipeline that can be used to train and evaluate image classification models. In this project you will implement a set of classification models then apply them to a dataset of images in the context of domestic service robots.

# Project 2:

The objective of this project is to gain experience building and training neural networks as multi layer perceptrons. In this project you will implement a fixed size two layer neural network and a set of generic network layers that can be used to build and train multi layer perceptrons.

# Project 3:

The objective of this project is to gain experience building and training convolutional neural networks for classificaiton and detection. In this project you will implement a feed forward CNN for image classification and a version of Faster R-CNN for object detection.

# Project 4:

The objective of this project is to gain experience building and training convolutional neural networks for 6 degrees-of-freedom rigid body pose estimation. In this project you will implement a version of PoseCNN for object pose estimation.
